# Project Title

Face Feneration using GAN


## Introduction
This was my last project in 17-week Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation.In this project, I used a generative adversarial network to generate new images of faces.

Two datasets were provided for the implementation this project:
- MNIST
- CelebA

Since the celebA dataset is complex and I did GANs in a project for the first time, the Udacity suggested to test the neural network on MNIST before CelebA.

Further Steps involved:

- The given dataset was preprocessed.
- Built the network by implementing various functions:
--> model_inputs,
--> discriminator,
--> generator,
--> model_loss,
--> model_opt,
--> train
- Obtained results in the form of new faces.
